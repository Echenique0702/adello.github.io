So you think you know what it takes to build a leading-edge real-time software platform? You know how to process billions of bid requests every day at millisecond latency? You believe you know Machine Learning, detecting patterns across 'real' big data (and we are talking about petabytes, and worldwide) to predict accurately? How about if you put all of that together - are you still up for it? And are you excited to not just write great code, but to solve challenging problems?
If yes, then you might be the next amazing person to join our technology team at Adello.
