This developer blog started from a challenge during a team dinner. When debating the merits of various proposals of mine my team told me that talk is cheap and that in the end I will be measured by my actions. And the one example mentioned was the developer blog which I (and my predecessors obviously) keept talking about as our visibile statement to our engineering culture in Adello. 

And looking back I had been there once before - 3 years ago as CTO of [Haufe Group](https://www.haufegroup.com). And it is ironic that again I am faced with the very same challenges. We are probably one of the few startups who run Machine Learning globally and at scale on top of Petabyte Data and who are actually having a thriving business powered by algorithms. Yet no one knows us. Other's talk about Machine Learning and have the powerpoints and flashy websites, yet we finally managed to (re)launch [our website](https://wwww.adello.com) two months ago.

Since the problems are so similar (and I guess ate systemic to most German tech startups and probably rooted in certtain cultural aspects) and my word from back then still ring true, I did what every good and honest developer would do - I copied my article from three years ago and only changed the company name. (Just some creative interpreting of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle - Don't Repeat Yourself ;))

No, our problem is that we are actually doing quite some cool stuff (and planning even more in the future) and no one in the developer community knows about it. When I joined Adello as CTO back in May of this year the first thing I did was that I searched for Adello on my usual (developer) channels: Github (nope), Twitter (nope), SlideShare (nope). Well, you see - I think that is a problem. If a tree falls in the forest but no one sees it - did the tree fall in the forest? How are you ever going to find out about us and get so excited that you want to join us - right now!

During the 'Meet the new guy' meeting with my team I drew a triangle with the three areas I would like to focus on first: Architecture, Technology and Developer Culture. I figured developing Developer Culture was the easiest - and boy was I naive (and wrong). Fast forward 3 month and I think that developer culture is the number one factor which will determine if we as a team and as company will succeed or fail. No matter what technology or architecture we use, it is the culture which permeates every decision we make at work day in and day out. It is culture which incluences if we go left or if we go right, if we speak up or if we remain silent. Without the right kind of culture, everything else is just band-aid.

You see, I am a pretty opiniated guy. I can probably talk for hours about Microservices, API's, Docker and so on. But if you ask  me today what I think my biggest lever to affect lasting change will be, then shaping and influencing the direction of our dev culture will be my answer. Technoloy and architecure are just manifestations of that culture. Sure they need to be aligned, but **culture eats strategy for breakfast**. And how we share our stories, how we talk about what we learned and what worked and what not, are important first steps of this cultural journey.

And yes, once more I would like to invite you to listen in to our stories and find those few nuggets helpful for your own journey. And again we are hoping to return something to the larger community from whom we have and are still learning. So here is the beginning of our (and my next) story ..
